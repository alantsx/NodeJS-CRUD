# NodeJS-Course
This repository saves my studies regarding basic NodeJS. The final project from this course is a simple CRUD for products system where we use mongoDb.

So in this system I use nodemon to scan and auto-refresh the server when a file is saved. I also use mongoDB installed in a virtual machine through Docker and manage it through Robot3T. On this course I also learned to use NodeJS to create schema models and manage the database instead of database language.

Further node-modules and dependencies not uploaded, as the plan is just to upload the core-code.
